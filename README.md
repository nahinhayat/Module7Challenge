Module 7 Challenge

Desription:

In this challenge I used Raw SQL Queries to read data and create tables which ultimately lead me to analyze ETF Portfolios. I then deployed the Jupyter Notebook I did this analysis in as a web application.

Details:

These are the libraries I imported in and then the process of setting up the engine that interacts with SQLite database:

Next using an SQL querie, a DataFrame was created with all the data from the PYPL asset for analysis

After some work, the cumulative returns for PYPL was found. It was then illustrated in this interavtive line plot

To begin analyzing all of the assets in the portfolio, a dataframe with all of the asset's tables was created with an SQL query

These asset's were then analyzed and the cumulative returns were plotted, this is that illustartion deployed in a web application:
